This is an interactive visualization of all HIV type 1 proteins of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The project is divided into three tabs showing different data. <br>
The goal is to explore the distribution of different protein classes (tab1), the relationship of molecular weight and number of residues (tab2) and the number of added protein structures per year (tab3), serving educational or scientific purposes.
